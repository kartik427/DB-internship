// An async function is a function declared with the async
//  keyword, and the await keyword is permitted
//   within it. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, 
//   promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style,
//    avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.

// async return promises , inside async a promise is resolved.
// whenever it hits await it check if all the lines in the JS file are excuted or not
// and after excuting all the js statements the await works promise resolved.
